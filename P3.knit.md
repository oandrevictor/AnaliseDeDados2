## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
training.data.raw <- read.csv('lab3_kaggle_classificacao_treino.csv',header=T)

training.by.year <- training.data.raw[c(1,4,7)]

training.by.year <- aggregate(MAT_TUR_ANO ~ MAT_ALU_MATRICULA + EVADIU, training.by.year,  FUN= mean)

#Get only the data of students that evade
evasions.by.year <- subset(training.by.year, EVADIU)
training.data.raw <- training.data.raw %>% mutate(DISCIPLINA = as.factor(gsub(" ",".",DISCIPLINA)))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="P3_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
